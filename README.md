# Choropleth map of India using Folium
This is an example to create choropleth of India based on any stat, using folium and geojson. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites


```
virtualenv
python3
```

### Installing



```
cd <directory of your choice>
git clone https://github.com/rajesh241/foliumIndiaChoropleth
cd foliumIndiaChoropleth

Creating Virtual Env and downloading packages

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
